# Gatekeeper Policy Manager (GPM)

<!-- KFD-DOCS -->

Gatekeeper Policy Manager is a simple **read-only** web UI for viewing OPA Gatekeeper policies' status in a Kubernetes Cluster.

GPM can display all the defined **Constraint Templates** with their rego code, all the Gatekeeper Configuration CRDs, and all the **Constraints** with its current status, violations, enforcement action, matches definitions, etc.

The target Kubernetes Cluster can be the one where GPM is deployed or some [remote cluster(s) using a kubeconfig file][gpm-multicluster-readme].

## Requirements

You'll need [OPA Gatekeeper][gatekeeper-pkg] running in your cluster and at least some constraint templates and constraints defined to take advantage of this tool.

### Resources

- CPU: 500m
- Memory: 256M

## Deploying GPM

To deploy Gatekeeper Policy Manager to your cluster, apply the provided `kustomization` file running the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -k .
```

By default, this will create a deployment and a service both with the name `gatekeper-policy-manager` in the `gatekeeper-system` namespace. We invite you to take a look into the `kustomization.yaml` file to do further configuration.

We recommend you to create an ingress for the application, you can find a sample [here][gpm-ingress-ex]

## Configuration

GPM is a stateless application, but it can be configured using environment variables. The possible configuration options are:

| Env Var Name                      | Description                                                                                                      | Default                                  |

> ⚠️ Please notice that OIDC Authentication is in beta state. It has been tested to work with Keycloak as a provider.

You can find a sample patch for these environment variables in the upstream [`enable-oidc.yaml`](https://github.com/sighupio/gatekeeper-policy-manager/blob/v0.4.0/manifests/enable-oidc.yaml) file.

Apply it as a patch, adding the following to your `kustomization.yaml` file:

```yaml
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - enable-oidc.yaml
```
