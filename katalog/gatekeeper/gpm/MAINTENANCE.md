# Gatekeeper Policy Manager Package Maintenance

To maintain the GPM package, you'll need to keep updated with upstream the following files:

- `README.md`
- `*.yaml`

For the readme, the important section to keep updated is the configuration parameters table.

For the manifests files (`*.yaml`), you'll need to download the files from upstream and diff them to the local ones. You can find the URL of each one as a comment in the first lines.
