# Monitoring

<!-- <KFD-DOCS> -->

This package includes:

- a Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` definition to instruct the SKD Monitoring module to gather the metrics from Gatekeeper
- a custom set of Prometheus rules to alert when Gatekeeper's webhooks are misbehaving
- a custom Grafana Dashboard that shows the mentioned metrics in a nice visual way.
