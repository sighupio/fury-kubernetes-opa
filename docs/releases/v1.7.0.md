# OPA Core Module Release v1.7.0

Welcome to the latest release of `OPA` module of [Kubernetes Fury Distribution](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution) maintained by team SIGHUP.

This is a minor release updating the Gatekeeper and Gatekeeper Policy Manager packages to the latest versions from upstream and fixing a bug in the provided ConstraintTemplates that made the audit not to trigger.

This release also includes a set of custom Prometheus alerts that get triggered when the Gatekeeper webhooks are misbehaving.
