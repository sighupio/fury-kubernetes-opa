# OPA Core Module Release v1.7.0

Welcome to the latest release of the `OPA` module of [Kubernetes Fury Distribution](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution) maintained by team SIGHUP.

This release includes the following changes:

- Gatekeeper has been updated to v3.9.0 with mutating capabilities in *beta*.
- The custom rules have been updated to use `constraintTemplates` v1 and improved with added descriptions and better deny messages.
- The Gatekeeper audit process for the provided constraints now triggers violations for pre-existing resources.
- A set of custom Prometheus alerts that get triggered when the Gatekeeper webhooks are misbehaving for more than 5 min\* has been added.
- The Grafana Dashboard for Gatekeeper has been updated.
- Gatekeeper Policy Manager has been updated to v1.0.0, including a revamped UI.
- Gatekeeper Policy Manager now uses local manifests instead of pulling them at `kustomize build` time.
- The module's documentation has been updated and improved.

> \* The alert for webhooks failing in `Ignore` mode requires Kubernetes version 1.24 or later.
