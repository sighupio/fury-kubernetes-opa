# Policy Core Module Release 1.6.2

Welcome to the latest release of `Policy` module of [SIGHUP
Distribution](https://github.com/sighupio/distribution) maintained by team
SIGHUP by ReeVo.

This is a patch release fixing a bug with a missing mount for `gatekeeper-audit` and reverts the `commonLabels` applied in `v1.6.0` because they break updating the module in the future.

> ðŸ’¡ Please refer the release notes of the minor version
> [`v1.6.0`](https://github.com/sighupio/module-policy/releases/tag/v1.6.0)
> if you are upgrading from a version `< v1.6.0`

## Update Guide ðŸ¦®

### Warnings

- Since the release rollbacks some changes to immutable fields, if `deployments`, `statefulset` and `daemonsets`, are not deleted first before applying the module, it will error out. Check the Process below for more info.

### Process

If you are upgrading from version `v1.6.0` or `v1.6.1` to `v1.6.2` you need to download this new version and then apply the `kustomize` project as shown below.

There will be **downtime** on the components.

```bash
# Delete the validating webhook to avoid downtime while performing the upgrade
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io gatekeeper-validating-webhook-configuration
# Delete the deployments with the labels, so they can be upgraded
kubectl delete -n gatekeeper-system deployments.apps gatekeeper-policy-manager gatekeeper-audit gatekeeper-controller-manager
# Finally, apply the new version
kustomize build katalog/gatekeeper | kubectl apply -f -

 ```

If you are upgrading from a version `< v1.6.0`, you can simply apply the `kustomize` project as shown below.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/gatekeeper | kubectl apply -f -
```
