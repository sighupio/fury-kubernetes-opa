## Update Guide ðŸ¦®

### Warnings

- Since the release rollbacks some changes to immutable fields, if `deployments`, `statefulset` and `daemonsets`, are not deleted first before applying the module, it will error out. Check the Process below for more info.

### Process

If you are upgrading from version `v1.6.0` or `v1.6.1` to `v1.6.2`, you need to download this new version, then apply the `kustomize` project as shown below.
There will be **some downtime** on the components.

```bash
kubectl delete deployments cerebro -n logging 
kustomize build katalog/cerebro | kubectl apply -f -

kubectl delete cronjob curator -n logging
kustomize build katalog/curator | kubectl apply -f -
# or
kubectl delete cronjob curator -n logging
kustomize build katalog/curator-s3 | kubectl apply -f -

kubectl delete statefulset elasticsearch -n logging
kustomize build katalog/elasticsearch-single | kubectl apply -f -
# or
kustomize delete statefulset elasticsearch -n logging
kustomize build katalog/elasticsearch-triple | kubectl apply -f -

kubectl delete statefulset fluentd -n logging
kubectl delete daemonset fluentbit -n logging
kustomize build katalog/fluentd | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl delete deployment kibana -n logging
kustomize build katalog/kibana | kubectl apply -f -
```

If you are upgrading from a version `< v1.6.0`, you can simply apply the `kustomize` project as shown below.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/gatekeeper | kubectl apply -f - --force
```
