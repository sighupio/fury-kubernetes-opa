# OPA Core Module version 1.2.1

This release removes the cert-manager dependency created in
[1.2.0](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-opa/releases/tag/v1.2.0) due to a [fix applied to the
gatekeeper upstream project](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/pull/811)

## Changelog

- Update gatekeeper. From `v3.1.0` to `v3.1.1`.
  - Avoid deploying `cert-manager` as a Gatekeeper requirement.

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.1.0` or `v1.2.0` to `v1.2.1`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/gatekeeper | kubectl apply -f - --force
```

### Important note

#### Update from v1.1.0

This version changes the labels for `gatekeeper-controller-manager`, so the usual `kustomize build | kubectl apply -f`
should be used together with the `--force` flag, or the `gatekeeper-controller-manager` deployment should be deleted
manually before applying this new version.
