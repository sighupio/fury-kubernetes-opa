### Process

To upgrade this core module from `v1.12.0` to `v1.13.0`, you need to download this new version, then apply the `kustomize` project. No further action is required.

> From Kyverno v1.12.0, policies using long-deprecated or invalid operators in conditions (ex., In and NotIn) will be blocked.
Here is the list of valid operators: [Kyverno Operators](https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/preconditions/#operators)

```bash
kustomize build katalog/gatekeeper | kubectl apply -f -
```
