# OPA Core Module version TBD

SIGHUP team maintains this module updated and tested. That is the main reason why we worked on this new release.
With the Kubernetes 1.20 release, it became the perfect time to start testing this module against this Kubernetes
release. Minor works have been done in the constraint templates.

  - Deprecate Kubernetes 1.16 support.
  - Kubernetes 1.19 is considered stable.
  - Add tech-preview support to Kubernetes 1.20.
