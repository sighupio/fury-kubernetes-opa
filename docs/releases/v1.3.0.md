# Policy Core Module version v1.3.0

SIGHUP team maintains this module updated and tested. That is the main reason why we worked on this new release.
With the Kubernetes 1.20 release, it became the perfect time to start testing this module against this Kubernetes
release. Minor works have been done in the constraint templates.

- Update Gatekeeper version from: 3.1.1 to [3.2.2](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/releases/tag/v3.2.2)
- Include Gatekeeper Policy Manager, GPM, from our amazing @ralgozino. [0.4.1](https://github.com/sighupio/gatekeeper-policy-manager/releases/tag/v0.4.1).
- Adds `excludeIstio` flag to:
  - `K8sLivenessProbe`
  - `K8sReadinessProbe`
  - `SecurityControls`
  This feature excludes the checks on istio sidecar containers.
- Improve `k8suniqueingresshost` constraint template to check `path` + `host` tuple instead of just the `host`.
Thanks to @phisco who made it possible.
- Kubernetes support:
  - Deprecate Kubernetes 1.16 support.
  - Kubernetes 1.19 is considered stable.
  - Add tech-preview support to Kubernetes 1.20.
- All the container images come from the SIGHUP registry to avoid rate limits.
