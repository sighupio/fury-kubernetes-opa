# OPA Core Module version 1.10.0

SIGHUP team maintains this module updated and tested. That is the main reason why we worked on this new release.
With the Kubernetes 1.19 release, it became the perfect time to start testing this module against this Kubernetes
release. The team behind Open Policy Agent finally released the first 3 stable release and it includes something we
were waiting for some time: High Availability support.
Continue reading the [Changelog](#changelog) to discover them:

## Changelog

- Update gatekeeper. From `v3.1.0-beta.9` to `v3.1.0`
  - Re-enable High Availability
  - The Grafana dashboard is now part of this module
  - Namespaces `kube-system` and `gatekeeper-system` namespaces are exempted.
  - huge kudos to @ralgozino for the amazing work done here

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.1.0` to `v1.2.0`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/gatekeeper | kubectl apply -f - --force
```

### Important note

This version changes the labels for `gatekeeper-controller-manager`, so the usual `kustomize build | kubectl apply -f`
should be used together with the `--force` flag, or the `gatekeeper-controller-manager` deployment should be deleted
manually before applying this new version.
