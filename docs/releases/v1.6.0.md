Welcome to the latest release of `OPA` module of (`Kubernetes Fury
Distribution`)[https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution] maintained by team

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

- This release involves recreation of certain resources like daemonset, deployments, etc. We recommend deleting it with `--cascade=orphan`, to avoid changes being made to the pods.
- We drop support of Kubernetes versions <= v1.19.x

## Breaking Changes üíî

- [#40](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-opa/pull/40) Added Kubernetes labels to all the components of the module: Since `labels` are immutable fields in deployments, daemonsets, etc., this change requires a recreation of those resources.

## Features üí•

- [#35](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-opa/pull/35) Protecting deletion of namespaces
  - Add a Constraint Template to protect namespaces for being deleted. If you want to avoid accidental deletion of namespace, add annotation to your namespace
    ```yaml
    annotations:
    opa.sighup.io/indelible-ns: "yes"
    ```

    Otherwise to enable deletion use the annotation:

    ```yaml
    annotations:
    opa.sighup.io/indelible-ns: "no"
    ```

    If you don't put any annotation, the default is to protect the namespace.

    By default the constraint is disabled - while the constrainttemplate is deployed - , but you can enable it by removing the comment in the line in the [kustomization.yaml](../../katalog/gatekeeper/rules/constraints/kustomization.yaml)
  - Now Gatekeeper can also watch for `DELETE` events as well. If this is enabled, you have custom constraints *you have to* adapt them in order to handle this with something like the follow rego code:
    ```go
    operation := input.review.operation
    any([ operation == "CREATE", operation == "UPDATE" ])
    operation != "DELETE"
    ```
    By default, this is disabled, to enable you have to remove the comment in the `DELETE` line in file [vwh.yml]((../../katalog/gatekeeper/core/vwh.yaml))
- [#40](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-opa/pull/40) Added e2e-test support for k8s runtime `1.23`
- [#40](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-opa/pull/40) Added Makefile, JSON builder and .bumpversion config to the module
- [#41](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-opa/pull/41) Upgrade `gatekeeper` image to `v3.7.0`
- [#42](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-opa/pull/42) Add k8s 1.23 e2e-testing support for OPA module
- [#43](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-opa/pull/43) update Gatekeeper Policy Manager to v0.5.1

## Update Guide ü¶Æ

### Warnings

- Since the release ships changes to some immutable fields, if `deployments` and `daemonsets`, are not deleted first before applying the module, it will error out.
- Since the introduction of the protected namespace constrainttemplate, implies the `DELETE` events filtering by Gatekeeper, please check that the Gatekeeper resources are set accordingly with this change, because now the load will increase.

### Process

To upgrade this core module from `v1.11.x` to `v1.12.0`, you need to download this new version, then apply the `kustomize` project.

```bash
kubectl -n gatekeeper-system delete deployment.apps/gatekeeper-audit deployment.apps/gatekeeper-controller-manager deployment.apps/gatekeeper-policy-manager --cascade=orphan # This delete deployments, ds, etc. so the newly added labels can be applied
kustomize build katalog/gatekeeper | kubectl apply -f- --force
```
