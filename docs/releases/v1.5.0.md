# Policy Core Module version 1.5.0

`module-policy` is part of the SIGHUP maintained [SIGHUP
Distribution](https://github.com/sighupio/distribution). The module
provides a policy engine based on Gatekeeper to enable custom policy
enforcement to be deployed on the Kubernetes cluster based on Velero.
Team SIGHUP makes it a priority to maintain these modules in compliance
with CNCF and with all the latest features from upstream.

This release introduces the support for Kubernetes runtime `1.22` and
drops support for `1.18`. Refer the [Compatibility
Matrix](https://github.com/sighupio/module-policy#compatibility) for more.
